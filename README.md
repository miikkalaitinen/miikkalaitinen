Hi, and welcome to my Github profile!

I'm a 22-year old Finn studying Information networks at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en).

I'm intrested in software development, and especially web development. 
I have good frontend development skills using React, as well as some experience working Fullstack wih React, Nodejs and SQL databases. 
I'm currently looking to improve my skills in Fullstack as well as get some working experience in software development.
